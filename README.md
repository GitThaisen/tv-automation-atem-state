# Sofie: The Modern TV News Studio Automation System (ATEM State library)
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/nrkno/tv-automation-atem-state.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/nrkno/tv-automation-atem-state)

This library is used in our state-based playout system. It can compare two ATEM states and generate the necessary commands for the ATEM-connection library to send to the ATEM device such that it will reach the target state.

_Note: this library is a work in progress_
